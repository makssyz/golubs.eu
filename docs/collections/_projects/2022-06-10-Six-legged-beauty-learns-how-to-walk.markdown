This student research project combines open-source machine learning tools with affordable robotics hardware to create a usable movement system for a six-legged robot. Linking these two technologies includes designing a simulated 3D model and a communication interface that can handle the simulation data in the real world.
Machine learning helps to optimize and streamline processes. It is a central tool in modern analytics, driving statistical research. One form, reinforcement learning, harnesses evolutionary learning to create algorithms based on repetition and constant improvement, making it more cost-efficient than supervised learning and suitable for many real-world problems.
On the other hand, robotics has made astonishing advancements over the last decades. For example, specialized robots do the jobs of former assembly line workers, or logistics personnel, while legged robots can do on-premise operational work in any environment designed around humans.
Joining the possibilities of two modern technologies and combining them into one workflow is the goal this project aims to achieve.
