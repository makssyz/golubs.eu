During my internship at IBM, I had the opportunity to contribute to the **Open Mainframe Project**, specifically working on [Tessia](https://openmainframeproject.org/blog/what-is-tessia/) — an open-source tool that automates and simplifies the installation, configuration, and testing of Linux on Z systems. Originally an internal IBM project, Tessia was open-sourced in 2020 to foster collaboration and innovation within the community.

My role involved working with a small team to develop **tooling for automated installation and testing** of Linux on mainframes. This required an understanding of **virtualization, containerization, and mainframe computing**, as well as active participation in agile development workflows. My contributions primarily focused on fixing small bugs in the production system, which helped me gain deeper insights into the **software development lifecycle** and **agile methodologies**.

# Agile Development in an International Team

Working in a distributed team across different time zones required effective collaboration and adaptability. The **agile methodology** we followed emphasized iterative improvements, continuous feedback, and structured workflows. Throughout the internship, I gained a better appreciation for how agile practices enhance software development, particularly in large-scale, open-source projects.

Maintaining **clean and well-documented code** was a crucial aspect of our work. Open-source contributions require clarity and structure to ensure long-term maintainability and ease of onboarding for new developers. Through my involvement, I learned the importance of **test-driven development, clear documentation, and structured version control**.

# Key Takeaways

- **Understanding Mainframe Architecture**: Working with IBM Z systems provided insights into enterprise computing, which differs significantly from conventional server environments.
- **The Role of Documentation**: As team members transitioned in and out of the project, the importance of comprehensive documentation became clear. Without it, valuable knowledge is easily lost.
- **Agile and Open-Source Synergy**: The open-source nature of Tessia meant that decisions were more transparent, and the iterative nature of agile development helped streamline contributions and reviews.
- **Bug Fixing as a Learning Tool**: My contributions to the project were modest but meaningful. Fixing small bugs in a production environment allowed me to grasp the software development lifecycle and the impact of incremental improvements.

# Conclusion

Developing software for complex systems like mainframes is an ongoing challenge that requires collaboration across disciplines. Agile methodologies and open-source principles help maintain structure and continuity, making large-scale projects more sustainable over time. My internship at IBM gave me firsthand experience in these dynamics, shaping my understanding of software development in enterprise environments.

This experience was not just about writing code but about understanding how software engineering works in a corporate and open-source setting. It highlighted the critical role of **communication, maintainability, and adaptability** in the field—lessons that will undoubtedly shape my future projects.
