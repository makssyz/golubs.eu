During my internship at IBM, I got a front-row seat to the world of mainframes—those mythical beasts of enterprise computing. Specifically, I worked on [Tessia](https://openmainframeproject.org/blog/what-is-tessia/), an open-source tool that automates and simplifies the installation, configuration, and testing of Linux on IBM Z systems. Originally an internal IBM project, Tessia was open-sourced in 2020, letting the community get their hands dirty with mainframe automation.

### Taming the Automation Beast

My job? Build tooling to automate the installation and testing of Linux on these massive machines. This meant getting comfortable with **virtualization, containerization, and mainframe computing**, while also navigating the sometimes-chaotic world of open-source development.

Most of my work revolved around fixing bugs in production—small but crucial changes that improved reliability. Sure, they weren’t headline-grabbing features, but they taught me a lot about the **software development lifecycle** and **agile methodologies** in large-scale projects.

### Agile, Open-Source, and International Chaos

Working with a team spread across time zones meant learning the art of asynchronous collaboration. We followed **agile development** principles—iterative improvements, continuous feedback, and structured workflows. The open-source nature of the project added an extra layer of transparency, making every decision more visible (and sometimes more debated).

Writing **clean, well-documented code** was a non-negotiable. Open-source projects live and die by their documentation—if future contributors can’t understand what you wrote, it might as well not exist. I learned firsthand how **test-driven development, version control discipline, and clear documentation** keep a project from spiraling into chaos.

### Lessons from the Mainframe Trenches

- **Mainframes are a different beast**: IBM Z isn’t just another Linux box. It’s a world of high-availability, enterprise-grade computing that operates on a different scale.
- **Documentation is everything**: With contributors coming and going, good documentation is the difference between continuity and complete confusion.
- **Agile and open-source work surprisingly well together**: The transparency of open-source combined with agile workflows made for an efficient, feedback-driven development cycle.
- **Bug fixing is underrated**: Small fixes add up. Debugging production issues taught me how seemingly minor tweaks can make a system far more robust.

### Wrapping Up

Developing software for mainframes isn’t just about writing code—it’s about keeping incredibly complex systems running smoothly. My time at IBM immersed me in this world, where **collaboration, maintainability, and adaptability** are just as important as technical skills.

This wasn’t just a coding internship—it was a lesson in how software development works at scale. And honestly? It was pretty fun.
