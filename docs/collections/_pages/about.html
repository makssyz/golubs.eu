        Welcome to the life of Makss, where computer science meets animal rights activism, 
        Swiss precision blends with German efficiency, and a dash of Latvian flair keeps things interesting.
        Who am I, you ask? Well, I'm like that one dish on the menu that combines 
        unexpected ingredients but somehow works deliciously well together.
        Picture this: born in the cold climates of Latvia, with a youth spent navigating the orderly streets of Germany,
        I'm hailing from the land of Swiss railways and direct democracy, all while carrying a fiery passion for Europe in my heart.

        But wait, there's more! When I'm not busy tinkering with code or optimizing my smart home 
        (because why not make your toaster talk to your coffee maker?), you'll find me on the frontline of animal rights activism. 
        I firmly believe that every creature deserves a life free from suffering, and I'm not afraid to hurt a few animal abuser's feelings to make that happen.

        I'm also a member of the Green Party of Switzerland. Yes, I'm that person at the dinner party who will 
        happily engage you in a discussion about modern urbanism while plotting the downfall of the automobile industry. 
        Because let's face it, city centers should be made for people, not four-wheeled metal beasts.

        But hey, it's not all serious business in my world. I also have a soft spot for digital drawing, 
        because who doesn't love art? And when I'm feeling particularly whimsical, you might catch me indulging in a round of improv,
        because life's too short to stick to a script.
