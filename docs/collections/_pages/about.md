        <p>I’m Makss, a technical IT professional with a background in computer science, programming, and business analysis. By
        day, I work in tech—solving problems, building systems, and making sense of complex data. But my interests extend far
        beyond the digital world.</p>

        <p>I have backgrounds in Latvia, Germany, and Switzerland, and I consider myself European at heart. My passion for
        community, urban development, and railways keeps me engaged with how people connect—both digitally and in the physical
        world. Cities should work for people, not just cars, and I believe in shaping environments that foster interaction and
        sustainability.</p>

        <p>Animal rights activism is a core part of my life. I believe in a world where non-human animals are treated with
        dignity,
        and I work actively to challenge industries that exploit them. I also enjoy improvisation theater, where the thrill of
        unscripted moments reminds me that creativity thrives in spontaneity.</p>

        <p>Music is another constant in my life—I play the ukulele and piano, finding joy in both structured melodies and
        free-form
        expression. Whether it’s a well-planned campaign, an impromptu performance, or a late-night coding session, I’m drawn
        to
        the balance between structure and flexibility.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, I’m motivated by building things—whether it’s better software, stronger communities, or a more just
        world.
        If you’re interested in technology, activism, or the intersections of both, I’d love to connect.</p>
