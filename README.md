# Welcome

This is my personal portfolio & blog page, created from the wonderful [Vonge](https://github.com/CloudCannon/vonge-jekyll-bookshop-template/tree/main/site) Jekyll template and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Except for my domain (which you can reach at https://www.golubs.eu) my website was made at zero-cost. A warm THANK YOU to the OpenSource community making this project possible.

# Develop Notes
